Arcums is an open source application, written in PHP and MySql, designed for managing radio stations.
The name Arcums stands for "Autmated Radio Catalog and User Management System", but it does a lot more than what the name suggests.

FEATURES:
User Management: Arcums' user management keeps DJ show information and profile organized for easy display.
Catalog System: Coupled with the Amazon and SudioScropbbler APIs Arcums' catalog system is designed to help manage a radio stations music catalog.  Adding albums is easy, either by entering the information manually or searching Amazon by keyword or a scanned UPC. While browsing the catalog, Arcum's will display all similar artists (via the AudioScrobbler API) that are available in your catalog as well.
